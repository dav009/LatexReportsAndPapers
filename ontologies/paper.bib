    abstract = {Previous work on paraphrase extraction using parallel or comparable corpora has generally not considered the documents&#146; discourse structure as a useful information source. We propose a novel method for collecting paraphrases relying on the sequential event order in the discourse, using multiple sequence alignment with a semantic similarity measure. We show that adding discourse information boosts the performance of sentence-level paraphrase acquisition, which consequently gives a tremendous advantage for extracting phrase-level paraphrase fragments from matched sentences. Our system beats an informed baseline by a margin of 50%.},

Manual ontology population is labour intensive and time consuming. Hence there is need to devise a method to provide fully automatic feeding of Web-based knowledge to the ontology. Moreover, for constructing ontology automatically, there is a need to discover a way to find, structure, and display the relationships between attributes and objects of a sentence. In this paper, a technique of Automatic Semantic Domain-ontology Populator (ASDP) towards construction of given domain modeled by the database is being proposed. ASDP is a way to find, structure, and display relationships between concepts, which consist of attributes and objects. This method helps in understanding a given domain and in building a domain model for it.</span></p>},
